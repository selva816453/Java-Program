// There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi.
// Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either 1 or 2.
// The cost of a path between any two nodes u and v is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.
// You are given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the path such that the cost of the path between ui and vi is odd.
// Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the number of valid assignments for queries[i].
// Since the answer may be large, apply modulo 109 + 7 to each answer[i].
// Note: For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node ui and vi.

 

// Example 1:
// Input: edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation:
// Query [1,1]: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.
// Query [1,2]: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (1 → 2). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.

// Example 2:
// Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]
// Output: [2,1,4]
// Explanation:
// Query [1,4]: The path from Node 1 to Node 4 consists of two edges (1 → 3 and 3 → 4). Assigning weights (1,2) or (2,1) results in an odd cost. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 2.
// Query [3,4]: The path from Node 3 to Node 4 consists of one edge (3 → 4). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
// Query [2,5]: The path from Node 2 to Node 5 consists of three edges (2 → 1, 1 → 3, and 3 → 5). Assigning (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), or (1,1,1) makes the cost odd. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 4.
 

// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// edges.length == n - 1
// edges[i] == [ui, vi]
// 1 <= queries.length <= 105
// queries[i] == [ui, vi]
// 1 <= ui, vi <= n
// edges represents a valid tree.
